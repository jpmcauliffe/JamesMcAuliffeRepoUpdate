    <p>Income inequality across the nation is contributing to obesity rates among minorities because expensive athletics programs are not an option for many minority families who have to choose between paying for their children’s athletics and buying food for their families. 
        <br>“With many activities requiring the purchase of equipment or access to fee-based amenities and facilities, members of low SES [(socioeconomic status)] groups are often left with limited access to quality sports opportunities.”
        <ul>
            <li>The high costs of athletic programs in all corners of the country makes it difficult for low-income families (disproportionately minorities) to give their children access to structured physical fitness. These families have to make tough decisions about where to spend their money, and often times sports programs are not seen as the priority. This leads to decreased physical activity among these children, among numerous other “mental” health concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>“Physical inactivity has become a major risk factor for racial minority groups, due to the direct impact that SES can have on physical activity”
        <ul>
            <li>The tough decisions made by families of low SES can often lead to physical inactivity among their children. While not the intended outcome, it can be hard for parents to escape as structured activity may be the only way to involve their children in physical activity. It can be hard for parents to motivate their children outside of structured programs, and many of these families live in “dangerous” neighborhoods where it may not be considered safe for a young child to undertake physical activity by themself.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>Not only is prospective talent kept out of the American soccer scene, but “children living in low-income neighborhoods are 20 to 60 percent more likely to be obese or overweight than children living in high socioeconomic status neighborhoods” 
        
        <br>The astronomical prices of structured sports in the United States severely limit the number of children involved because expensive programs are not considered worth the thousands of dollars they cost to families of all socioeconomic statuses. 
        
        <br>“The average household income in this country is about $52,000. The cost of one kid playing can be $6,000 or $7,000”
        <ul>
            <li>The cost of youth sports continues to rise quicker than the average household income. As this trend continues, many families are pulling their kids out of organized sports and they cannot spare the money needed to enroll. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>“With costs so high in many sports, both at the competitive and non-competitive levels, families can sometimes spend up to 10.5 percent of their yearly gross income”
        <ul>
            <li>For many families, 10.5% of their yearly gross income is a highly unreasonable amount to spend on youth sports. Many families have multiple children, often three or four but sometimes eight or nine. For a family with five children, they could be looking at spending more than 50% of their yearly gross income to enroll their children in youth sports, which is an impossible number for almost everyone. The high cost of organized sports continues to keep children away from participating.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>Implications
        <ul>
            <li>Less children involved</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heightened inactivity rates</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased chance of obesity, among other things</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Many children missing out on important values</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Low-income families blocked from participating </li>
            <ul>
                <li>High prices affect low-income families more</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>These families are disproportionately minorities</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Talent is blocked from reaching the regional, state, national level</li>
        </ul>
