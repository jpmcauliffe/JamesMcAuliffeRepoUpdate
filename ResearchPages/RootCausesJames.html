      Lowering the cost of organized sports programs will increase the participation of children because families will not have to restrict their children from playing due to cost reasons, and will therefore decrease the danger of obesity in low SES neighborhoods.         <ul>
            <li>The main limiting factor (for participation in organized athletics) at the moment is high cost. If we could lower the costs of organized athletics across the board, we would be able to involve a much larger number of children (from all socioeconomic status levels) in these programs.</li>
            <li>This would be especially beneficial for those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), who tend to need the organized programs the most. Without these programs, communities of lower SES have a much greater chance of obesity and similar conditions brought on by the lack of opportunities they are given.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>“Children living in low-income neighborhoods are 20 to 60 percent more likely to be obese or overweight than children living in high socioeconomic status neighborhoods” <a href="http://ebot.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/10914/Hartman_thesis_2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">(Hartman).</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        
        <br>In this situation, technology can be used to create and run cost-effectiveness and diversification algorithms, which will help us understand how we can lower the cost of organized athletics programs and include as many people as possible. 
        <ul>
            <li>At the moment, what is talked about most is that there is a big barrier to entry and that there is a lack of diversity and inclusion in organized sports programs. There has been minimal action or planning to try and combat this. </li>
            <li>Statistical analysis of cost-effectiveness (where the money is spent for/in these organized programs) will allow us to see where money can be better spent or even preserved. Doing this should help decrease the prices of the programs and lead to further inclusion of all different types of people.  </li>
              <ul>
                <li>“The cost of youth sports continues to rise quicker than the average household income” <a href="http://ebot.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/10914/Hartman_thesis_2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">(Hartman).</a></li>
                <li>“With costs so high in many sports …  families can sometimes spend up to 10.5 percent of their yearly gross income” <a href="http://ebot.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/10914/Hartman_thesis_2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">(Hartman).</a></li>
              </ul>
            <li>Algorithms to determine why and where there is a lack of diversity could help us understand where we can better these programs. Having an accurate statistical model of diversity and inclusion in organized athletic programs can play an important role in increasing the inclusivity and diversity of these programs, which benefits everyone.</li>
          </ul>

        <br>High costs disproportionately affect minorities 
        <ul>
            <li>This leads to under-involvement by minorities</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Which further leads to heightened inactivity rates</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meaning increased chances of obesity, among other physical and mental health issues for minorities</li>
                </ul>
                <li>This creates a lack of diversity within these sports programs</li>
                <li>This also prevents lots of talent from reaching the biggest stage</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Organized sports programs are more prominent in areas of higher SES (typically white)
              Oakland is one of the best places to conduct research as it is so diverse in both SES and race</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Important to use the resources I have around me</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Oakland Soccer Club, Oakland Genesis, Bay Oaks SC, Oakland Roots</li>
                    <li>UC Berkeley? Oakland Tech Archives? Peralta CC Archives?</li>
                  </ul>
