    The Questions: Why are youth sports so expensive? And what can we do to lower those costs?
  <br>For most sports in the United States, participation is based on the pay-to-play system. Prospective athletes are required to pay a fee, normally in the thousands of dollars, before they are allowed to play. This system restricts access to organized athletics and prevents many children of low socioeconomic status (SES) from involvement in these programs. Not only does this affect the talent pool for our national athletics, but it also leads to increased health and wellbeing concerns in those who are pushed away from organized sport.
  <br>Some noteable statistics:
    <ul>
      <li>“Children living in low-income neighborhoods are 20 to 60 percent more likely to be obese or overweight than children living in high socioeconomic status neighborhoods”</li>
      <li>“The average household income in this country is about $52,000. The cost of one kid playing can be $6,000 or $7,000”</li>
    </ul>
  <br>Here's what I plan to do: I plan to speak to members of the community who have experience with this issue. I plan to meet with a range of people from different levels of the sports industry: youth coaches, nonprofit organizers, professional players, and chief officers at Oakland Roots to enhance my knowledge and further my expertise. I plan to bring this knowledge into one, comprehensible space where members of the community can work together to lower the costs of sports programs in the surrounding area.
